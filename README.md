## Description

This is a simple (yet full stack) password generator web app. It was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the front end, and Express.js on the back end. It was then deployed on Vercel and so Express was not needed anymore. The design started on Figma and was then continued and adjusted during development.

This will be the first project showcased on my portfolio website. Serving as an introduction to my work and skills.

Heavily inspired by the [Frontend Mentor Password Generator](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/password-generator-app-Mr8CLycqjh) challenge.
